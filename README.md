## üöÄ How to Run

Because this is a self-contained static application, there are no build steps or complex installations.

### Method 1: The Easy Way (Local)

1.  **Download the Code:** Click the green `Code` button on the GitHub repo page and select `Download ZIP`.
2.  **Extract the Files:** Unzip the downloaded file on your computer.
3.  **Open the File:** Simply double-click the `index.html` file to open it in your default web browser.

That's it! The game will run locally.

### Method 2: Host on GitHub Pages (Live Demo)

You can easily host this project for free on GitHub Pages to share it with others.

1.  **Create a Repository:** Push this `index.html` file (and this `README.md`) to a new GitHub repository.
2.  **Navigate to Settings:** In your repository, go to the `Settings` tab.
3.  **Go to Pages:** In the left sidebar, click on `Pages`.
4.  **Configure the Source:**
    *   Under `Build and deployment`, set the `Source` to **Deploy from a branch**.
    *   Set the `Branch` to `main` (or `master`) and the folder to `/ (root)`.
5.  **Save:** Click `Save`.
6.  **Done!** After a minute or two, your site will be live at the URL shown on the Pages settings screen (e.g., `https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name/`).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack & Architecture

This project is intentionally kept simple and accessible.

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **HTML5:** Structures the application.
    *   **CSS3:** Handles all styling, including the responsive layout, animations, and theme. It uses CSS Variables for easy theme management.
    *   **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6):** Powers all game logic, DOM manipulation, and state management. No frameworks or external libraries are used (except for the Font Awesome CDN for icons).

*   **Architecture:**
    The JavaScript code follows a clear, object-oriented pattern:
    1.  **`mainManager`:** A central controller object that handles loading/saving history, showing the main menu, launching games, and displaying modals.
    2.  **`BaseGame` Class:** A parent class that provides a template for all games. It contains shared logic for initialization, rendering, scoring, and ending a game.
    3.  **Individual Game Classes:** Each of the 12 games is an instance of a class that extends `BaseGame`, overriding methods and adding its unique content and logic. This makes the code organized and scalable.
